# winProbabilityCalculator
## Matchup calculator using cloudscraped KenPom data



## 🏀 Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the outcomes of an NCAA college basketball game using reliable and continuously updated data.

Since the official KenPom website is subscription-blocked, I had to use a cloudscraper instead of a normal webpage parser to read in the data. Most websites that are subscription blocked will block requests, and the cloudscraper bypasses such blocks. KenPom in particular uses a software called Cloudflare which monitors internet traffic, web requests, and bots among other things. 

I used adjusted offensive/defensive efficiency, adjusted tempo alongside league averages of tempo and efficiency to calculate scores. I used offensive/defensive efficiency to approximate the scoring capability of both teams, and then calculated the approximate tempo to find the possessions in a game. Combining the two is how I was able to estimate the final score.

I calculated the win probability by finding the difference in scores and using a normal CDF function from SciPy

UPDATE: Streamlit/KenPom have recently updated their sites to automatically block scraping from popular site hosts. To work around this, I needed to webscrape the kenpom data locally and save the data as a csv. I then used this csv as my data for the main program. 
        When running the program locally, there is no change needed, and you can simply combine the scrap_kenpom and winProbabilityv2 files, just save the webscraped data as a DataFrame instead of a csv

## 📊 Data Source 
I used data scraped directly from the KenPom website. I collected everything on the main page, but only used offensive/defensive rating, adjusted tempo, and team names for my calculations
